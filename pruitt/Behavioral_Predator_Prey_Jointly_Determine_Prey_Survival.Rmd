# Introduction

Several papers co-authored by Professor Pruitt have been shown to contain unexplained duplication in the raw data (e.g., @Laskowski2020-retract).
This comment reports an attempt to find duplications in @Pruitt2012.

```{r n_snails}
#range of number of snails per mesocosm
n_snails <- raw_data %>% 
  count(mesocosm) %>% 
  summarise(min = min(n), mx = max(n))

```


# Data description and methods

Partial raw data for @Pruitt2012 are archived as an Excel file [@Pruitt2011_data].
The sheet `raw data` includes data for activity, size (as `N Max`), anti-predator response, and survivorship for `r nrow(raw_data)` snails in `r max(raw_data$mesocosm)` mesocosms.
Size and anti-predator response are presented as _z_-scores.
Within each mesocosm, which have between `r n_snails$min` and `r n_snails$mx` snails, the data are sorted by survival and partially sorted by snail size (Fig. \@ref(fig:raw-data-plot)).

```{r raw-data-plot, fig.cap = "Raw data from mesocosm 35"}
#example of raw data
raw_data %>% 
  select(mesocosm, survival_1_0, activity_level, size, n_anti_pred_response) %>% 
  mutate(row = 1:n()) %>%
  filter(mesocosm == 35) %>% 
  pivot_longer(c(activity_level, size, n_anti_pred_response)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = row, y = value, colour = factor(survival_1_0))) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_colour_viridis_d(option = "C", end = 0.8) +
  facet_wrap(~name, scales = "free_y", ncol = 1) +
  labs(x = "Row", y = "Value", colour = "Survival")
```

Because the data have been sorted, tests for duplicate sequences have a reduced utility because sequences may have been disrupted by sorting, or false positive duplicate sequences generated.

Instead, I test whether the overlap between measurements for the different mesocosms is higher than expected. 
With a slightly modified version of the `simba` package [@simba] in R [@R], I calculate the Ruggiero similarity [@Ruggiero1998] between mesocosms. 
The Ruggiero similarity ($a/(a + c)$) is one when all members of mesocosm 2 are in mesocosm 1. 
I make all duplicates values distinct, so if there are duplicate values in mesocosm 2, there needs to be at least as many duplicates of that value in mesocosm 1 to get a similarity of one. 

The expected distribution of Ruggiero similarities is estimated by permuting the data and recalculating the similarities `r n_ruggiero_rep` times.

Ruggiero similarities are less likely to be lower as diversity in the measurement increases. 
Table \@ref(tab:cardinality) shows that the anti-predator response has the lowest cardinality and diversity, whereas these are much higher for size, an important response variable. 

```{r cardinality}
#diversity of measurements
diversity <- raw_data %>% 
  select(size, n_anti_pred_response, activity_level) %>% 
  pivot_longer(everything(), names_to = "Variable") %>% 
  count(Variable, value) %>% 
  group_by(Variable) %>% 
  nest() %>% 
  mutate(
    `Shannon's H` = map_dbl(data, ~{select(.x, n) %>% vegan::diversity(index = "shannon", MARGIN = 2)}),
    N = map_int(data, nrow),
    `Hill's N1` = exp(`Shannon's H`)
  ) %>% 
  relocate(N, .after = Variable) %>% 
  select(-data)

diversity %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 2, 
               caption = "Cardinality (N), Shannon's index, and Hill's N1 diversity of the measurements for three snail response variables")
```



```{r ruggiero}
# similarity between size measurements in different mesocosms
ruggiero <- raw_data %>% 
  group_by(mesocosm, size) %>% 
  mutate(size2 = paste(size, 1:n(), sep = "_")) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  count(mesocosm, size2) %>% 
  sim(method = "ruggiero", listout = FALSE, listin = TRUE) 

#convert distance matrix to long tibble
 ruggiero2 <- ruggiero %>% 
    as.data.frame() %>% 
    rownames_to_column(var = "xid") %>% 
    pivot_longer(-xid, names_to = "yid", values_to = "rug") %>% 
    filter(xid != yid) %>%  # remove diagonal
    mutate(across(everything(), as.numeric))
 
#find similarity of mesocosms with permuted data 
random_ruggiero <- rerun(n_ruggiero_rep, {
  ruggiero <- raw_data %>% 
    mutate(size = sample(size)) %>% #randomise
    group_by(mesocosm, size) %>% 
    mutate(size2 = paste(size, 1:n(), sep = "_")) %>% 
    ungroup() %>% 
    count(mesocosm, size2) %>% 
    sim(method = "ruggiero", listout = FALSE, listin = TRUE) 

 ruggiero %>% 
    as.data.frame() %>% 
    rownames_to_column(var = "xid") %>% 
    pivot_longer(-xid, names_to = "yid", values_to = "rug") %>% 
    filter(xid != yid) %>%  # remove diagonal
    mutate(across(everything(), as.numeric))
})
```

# Results

Figure \@ref(fig:ruggiero-plots) shows that the Ruggiero similarities between some pairs of plots are much higher than expected from a random permutation of the data.
For example, `r sum(ruggiero2$rug == 1)` pairs of mesocosms have a Ruggiero similarity of 1, that is the measurements in the smaller mesocosm are a subset of those in the larger mesocosm.
A further `r sum(ruggiero2$rug > 0.8 & ruggiero2$rug < 1)` pairs of mesocosms have a Ruggiero similarity above 0.8.

```{r ruggiero-plots, fig.cap = glue::glue("For the snail size data, A) maximum Ruggiero similiarity between mesocosms for each of {n_ruggiero_rep} permutations, B) distribution of Ruggiero similiarities between the mesocosms in the archived data, C) Ruggiero similiarities between pairs of mesocosms.")}

  ggplot(aes(x = n, y = size, colour = in4)) + 
  geom_point()


```

# Conclusions

The presence of unexpectedly high similarities between size measurement in the different mesocosms may be indicative of data duplication.
High similarities were not detected in either the activity or anti-predator response data (results not shown).
